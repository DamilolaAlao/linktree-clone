# Linktree Clone ðŸŒ²

This is a project I built for my [blog](https://codingcastle.dev/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx8bwDAyeR5VfXPFk0j70-w). The backend is done with Strapi and GraphQL, the frontend uses Apollo to fetch data with the GraphQL code generator and Tailwindcss for styling.

## Installation

Run `yarn` in the root folder of this repo.

## Backend

Run `yarn develop` in the `packages/backend` folder.

## Frontend

Run `yarn dev` in the `packages/frontend` folder.
